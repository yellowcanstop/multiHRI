    Example:
        training_phases_durations_in_order = {
            (TeamType.LOW_FIRST, TeamType.SELF_PLAY_ADVERSARY): 0.5,  first 50% of the training time randomly select between low_first and self_play_adversary
            (TeamType.MEDIUM_FIRST): 0.125,                           next 12.5% of the training time
            (TeamType.HIGH_FIRST): 0.125,                             next 12.5% of the training time
        },

    For the rest of the training time (12.55%)
    Choose training types with the following probabilities
        rest_of_the_training_probabilities={
            TeamType.LOW_FIRST: 0.4,
            TeamType.MEDIUM_FIRST: 0.3,
            TeamType.HIGH_FIRST: 0.3,
        },

        probabilities_decay_over_time = 0.1,
    Everytime an update_happens, the probabilities will be updated
    probability_of_playing becomes:
        TeamType.LOW_FIRST: 0.4 - 0.1,
        TeamType.MEDIUM_FIRST: 0.3 + (0.1/2),
        TeamType.HIGH_FIRST: 0.3 + (0.1/2),


    WHENEVER we don't care about the order of the training types, we can set is_random=True.
    and we can just call Curriculum(train_types=sp_train_types, is_random=True) and ignore
    the rest of the parameters.

    Prioritized sampling can also be used to sample teammates such that the teammates with the worst historical
    performance are given the highest probability of selection. In this case, TeamTypes are ignored.
